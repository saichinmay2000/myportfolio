        title:"American Sign Language Classification",
        about:"Chatting with people having hearing and speaking disabilities is a significant challenge. Deaf and Mute people use their hand gestures sign language to communicate with other people. Hence ordinary people face problems in recognizing their language by signs made. Thus there is a need for systems that recognize the different signs and convey the information to ordinary people. Using Image Classification-CNN, we can detect many signs and hand gestures. This detector can be very helpful for deaf and mute people in communicating with others as knowing sign language is not something familiar to all",
